# Calculator Images

This directory contains product images for calculators.

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: WebP (preferred) or PNG
- **Naming**: Use the calculator slug (e.g., `casio-fx-991ex.webp`)
- **Size**: 800x800px minimum
- **Background**: White or transparent
- **Orientation**: Product should be centered and clearly visible

## Adding New Images

1. Obtain a high-quality product image (from manufacturer website or product photos)
2. Convert to WebP format for optimal performance
3. Name the file using the calculator's slug from the JSON data
4. Place the file in this directory

## Placeholder

Until actual product images are added, create simple placeholder images or use:
- Manufacturer website product photos
- Amazon product images
- Official calculator brand resources

**Note**: Ensure you have proper rights to use any images. Product photos for informational/educational use generally fall under fair use, but verify licensing.
