### 2. **Common Abbreviations & Aliases**

#### Calculator Aliases:
```
ti84      → TI-84, TI 84, Texas Instruments 84
ti89      → TI-89, TI 89, Texas Instruments 89
tinspire  → TI-Nspire, TI Nspire, Nspire
casio991  → fx-991, fx991, Casio 991, Casio fx 991
casio83   → fx-83, fx83, Casio 83, Casio fx 83
hpprime   → HP Prime, HP-Prime, Hewlett Packard Prime
```

#### Exam Aliases:
```
gcse    → GCSE, General Certificate of Secondary Education
sat     → SAT, Scholastic Assessment Test, College Board
act     → ACT, American College Testing

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File: `/src/app/api/search/route.ts`

#### Key Functions:

**1. normalize(text: string)**
```typescript
// Removes formatting for better matching
"TI-84 Plus CE" → "ti84plusce"
"fx-991EX" → "fx991ex"
```

**2. fuzzyScore(query: string, target: string)**
```typescript
// Returns 0-100 score based on match quality
fuzzyScore("ti84", "TI-84 Plus CE") → 90 (starts with)
fuzzyScore("casio", "Casio fx-991EX") → 90 (starts with)
fuzzyScore("991", "Casio fx-991EX") → 80 (contains)
```

**3. Alias Expansion**
```typescript
// Expands common abbreviations
query: "jee" → expandedQueries: ["jee", "joint entrance examination", "iit jee"]
```

**4. Scoring & Ranking**
- Checks multiple fields per item (model, brand, slug, notes)
- Takes maximum score from all checks
- Sorts results by score (highest first)
- Returns top 10 results

## 🎨 UI Enhancements

### Search Page (`/src/app/search/page.tsx`)

**New Elements:**
1. **Fuzzy search indicator** below input
2. **Smart search examples** panel (shown when empty)
3. **Quick-click buttons** on no results
4. **Improved result cards** with better formatting
5. **Loading spinner** during search

**Responsive Design:**
